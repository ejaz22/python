    "\n",
    "A generator is simply a function that returns an object on which you can call next, such that for every call it returns some value until it raises a Stop. Iteration exception, signaling that all values have been generated. Such an object is called an iterator. Normal functions return a single value using return, just like in Java. In Python, however, there is an alternative, called yield. Using yield anywhere in a function makes it a generator.\n",
